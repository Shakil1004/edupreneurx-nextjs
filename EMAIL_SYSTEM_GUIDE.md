# Email Automation System Guide

## Overview
The EduPreneurX platform now includes a fully automated email notification system using Resend. All emails are sent from `notification@access.edupreneurx.com` and follow the professional design pattern shown in the submission confirmation emails.

## Email Types

### 1. Submission Confirmation Email
**Triggered:** Automatically when a new submission is created
**Sent to:** User's email address
**Subject:** `âœ“ Submission Received - [Reference Number] | EduPreneurX`

- Submission date
- Personal information (name, email, phone, country)
- Program/position information
- Business idea, motivation, or enquiry message (if applicable)
- Payment information section (green box)
- Action required section (red box)

### 2. Status Update Email
**Triggered:** Automatically when submission status changes (e.g., new â†’ in-progress)
**Sent to:** User's email address
**Subject:** `Status Update: [New Status] - [Reference Number] | EduPreneurX`

**Content:**

**Special Features:**

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Resend API Key for email notifications
RESEND_API_KEY=re_JfoSkyzD_5BBiLDcnH8XmwBCF4mzk42cw

# Your Convex deployment URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://cautious-emu-310.convex.cloud
```

### Email Addresses
- **Sender:** `notification@access.edupreneurx.com` (configured in Resend)
- **Admin Recipient:** `info@edupreneurx.com`

### Cron Schedule
The daily digest runs at **9:00 AM UTC** every day. To change this, edit `convex/crons.ts`:

```typescript
crons.daily(
  "send daily admin digest",
  { hourUTC: 9, minuteUTC: 0 },  // Change these values
  internal.emails.sendDailyAdminDigest
);
```

## File Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ emails/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ submission-confirmation.ts  # Confirmation email template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ status-update.ts            # Status update email template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin-digest.ts             # Admin digest email template
â””â”€â”€ email-service.ts                # Resend integration service

app/
â””â”€â”€ api/
    â””â”€â”€ send-email/
        â””â”€â”€ route.ts                # API endpoint for sending emails

convex/
â”œâ”€â”€ emails.ts                       # Convex actions for email sending
â”œâ”€â”€ submissions.ts                  # Updated with email triggers
â””â”€â”€ crons.ts                        # Cron job configuration
```

## How It Works

### 1. User Submits Form
```
User fills form â†’ createSubmission mutation â†’
Save to database â†’ Schedule email action â†’
Send confirmation email to user
```

### 2. Admin Updates Status
```
Admin changes status â†’ updateSubmissionStatus mutation â†’
Check if status changed â†’ Schedule email action â†’
Send status update email to user
```

### 3. Daily Digest
```
Cron triggers at 9 AM UTC â†’ sendDailyAdminDigest action â†’
Query all "new" submissions â†’
Generate digest email â†’
Send to info@edupreneurx.com
```

## Email Design Features

- **Orange gradient header** with diamond pattern and EduPreneurX branding
- **White content sections** with clean, labeled information boxes
- **Color-coded status badges** for easy identification
- **Green action sections** for important next steps
- **Dark footer** with system information and version number
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## Testing

### Test Submission Confirmation Email
1. Create a new submission through any form
2. Check the user's email inbox
3. Verify all information matches the submission

### Test Status Update Email
1. Go to the admin dashboard at `/admin`
2. Select any submission
3. Change the status from "new" to "in-progress"
4. Check the user's email inbox
5. Verify the status transition is shown correctly

### Test Admin Digest Email
The digest runs automatically at 9 AM UTC, but you can test it by:
1. Ensure you have at least one submission with "new" status
2. Wait for the next scheduled run, or
3. Manually trigger the cron job from Convex dashboard

### Manual Testing via API
You can also test emails directly via the API endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/send-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "confirmation",
    "data": {
      "referenceNumber": "EduPX01012025TEST",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "country": "United States",
      "submissionType": "application",
      "programPosition": "GEEP",
      "submissionDate": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending
1. **Check Resend API Key:** Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env.local`
2. **Check Domain Verification:** Ensure `access.edupreneurx.com` is verified in Resend dashboard
3. **Check Convex Logs:** Look for errors in Convex dashboard under "Logs"
4. **Check API Route:** Test the `/api/send-email` endpoint directly

### Emails Going to Spam
1. Ensure your domain has proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
2. Check Resend dashboard for email delivery status
3. Consider adding a custom reply-to address

### Cron Not Running
1. Check Convex dashboard under "Crons" to see scheduled jobs
2. Verify `convex/crons.ts` is properly configured
3. Check Convex logs for any errors during cron execution

### Wrong Email Content
1. Verify submission data is being passed correctly
2. Check email templates in `lib/emails/` for correct field mappings
3. Look for console errors in browser and server logs

## Customization

### Change Email Design
Edit the template files in `lib/emails/`:
- `submission-confirmation.ts` - Confirmation email HTML
- `status-update.ts` - Status update email HTML
- `admin-digest.ts` - Admin digest email HTML

### Change Email Sender
Update `FROM_EMAIL` in `lib/email-service.ts`:
```typescript
const FROM_EMAIL = 'notification@access.edupreneurx.com';
```

### Change Admin Email
Update `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `lib/email-service.ts`:
```typescript
const ADMIN_EMAIL = 'info@edupreneurx.com';
```

### Add New Email Type
1. Create new template in `lib/emails/[template-name].ts`
2. Add function in `lib/email-service.ts`
3. Create action in `convex/emails.ts`
4. Add case in `app/api/send-email/route.ts`
5. Call from mutation or cron as needed
